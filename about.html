            <h2>Who we are</h2>
			<p>We are the University of North Carolina Chess Team. We are a school approved club who host events for not only students, but the public as well.</p>
            <p>We are open to all ages, cultures, and skill levels. Even if you've never seen a chess board before, we have people here who can get you started on your chess journey!</p>
            <p>For more advanced players, we do have a travel tournament team with a limited number of roster spots. We are currently ranked #1 among all colleges in the United States!</p>
            <p>The best part about us is that we are a non-profit organization, meaning there is no cost to those who participate. We do encourage donations, but they are certainly not necessary.</p>
